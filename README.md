# Android Javascript Engine Benchmark
A small application to benchmark various javascript engines in Android.

#### Benchmark Results
The benchmark script [can be found here](https://github.com/KevinBlock-GC/AndroidJavascriptEngineBenchmark/blob/main/app/src/main/java/com/example/jsengines/MainActivity.kt#L39). This script is executed 100 times every time a button is clicked.

Comes with a test suite that uses Androids Microbenchmark as well. All tests were ran on a Samsung Galaxy S23+

#### APK Size With Engine
These results simply use Android's APK analyze feature and looking at the "Download Size"
